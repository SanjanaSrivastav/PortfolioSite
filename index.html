    <p>Hi there! 👋🏽</p>
      <p>I am a Graphic Management Communications student at Ryerson University.
        Based in Toronto, ON, I am an aspiring <em>UX designer with a passion for tech
        and design!</em></p>
<!-- NOTE: Use this first page for Portfolio, 2nd page as more about me. Within
that 2nd page include more about degree section, work/ volunteeting experiences
and then a hyperlink to my resume page. Technically you can only work on the
2nd page as for now. -->
